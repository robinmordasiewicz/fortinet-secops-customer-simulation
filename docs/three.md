> What is the Fortinet Approach to security operations?

The Fortinet Approach to security operations is based on a comprehensive and integrated security fabric. It involves a combination of advanced technologies, threat intelligence, and automated processes to provide effective protection against cyber threats.

Fortinet's security operations approach includes the following key components:

1. Security Fabric: Fortinet's Security Fabric is a unified framework that integrates various security solutions and products into a single, cohesive system. It enables organizations to have a holistic view of their security posture and ensures consistent enforcement of security policies across the entire network.

2. Threat Intelligence: Fortinet leverages its global threat intelligence network, known as FortiGuard, to gather real-time information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. This intelligence is used to continuously update and enhance Fortinet's security solutions, enabling them to detect and mitigate new and evolving threats effectively.

3. Automation: Fortinet emphasizes the use of automation to streamline security operations and improve efficiency. Automated processes, such as threat detection, incident response, and policy enforcement, help reduce manual effort and enable security teams to focus on more strategic tasks.

4. Integration: Fortinet's security solutions are designed to seamlessly integrate with each other and with third-party security products. This integration enables organizations to leverage their existing security investments while benefiting from the enhanced capabilities provided by Fortinet's solutions.

5. Visibility and Analytics: Fortinet provides comprehensive visibility into network traffic, user behavior, and security events through its Security Operations Center (SOC) solutions. These solutions collect and analyze data from various sources to identify potential threats and provide actionable insights for proactive security measures.

Overall, the Fortinet Approach to security operations aims to provide organizations with a robust and scalable security infrastructure that can effectively defend against modern cyber threats.
